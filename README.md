## purpose
The purpose of the game is be aware of the lives of the diverse people around you by understanding how their gender, financial status, education, and hobbies correlate with their lifestyle and where they are in the social pyramid. It also shows how different choices and events impact one's social status.

## How It Works
Our webpage has two HTML files: main.html and welcome.html. Most of the work involved figuring out how to implement the swiping function, which we accomplished by using JavaScript and JQuery. The design for the website was coded in our style.css file.

Our Processing program is made up of three classes: a main, story, and ending class. The story class creates the storyline of the game. Likewise, the ending class creates the list containing the advantages and disadvatages that come from specific combinations of backgrounds. Lastly, the main class serves as the base structure by composing the visuals and the functionality between all the classes and instance variables.
